Journal App to create journals.
Every user needs to be created using a public API.
Every user can only create, see and delete their Journal Entries.
I have used Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, Mongo DB Atlas, Spring Security, Rest Template, Spring Scheduling , Java Mail Sender, Redis to make this project.
